# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This analysis aimed at identifying the number of employees per title from each department who are retiring. Additionally, this analysis helped to  identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
By using the ERD that I created earlier in the beginning of the module, I created the Retirement Titles table that held all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.Then I used the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contained the most recent title of each employee. After that, I used the COUNT() function to create a table that had the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. The result of that analysis were grouped by title and showed that there were only seven titles for the retiring employees.
